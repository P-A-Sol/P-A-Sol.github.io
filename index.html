                                Argent is the majority owner of P&A Sol with six years of programming and three years of management experience. At 18, he started
                                a painting business bringing in over $50,000 in sales in a city three hours away from his hometown with no connections in two months.
                                He hired and trained painters to carry out the work within the following two months. At 19, he worked freelance building websites and doing
                                I.T. service work for local businesses and politicians. At 20, he started e-commerce and within two years built two succesful stores making
                                over five and six figures respectively, SicWatches and SmartTechPicks. At Oregon State University, Argent was part of many organizations, 
                                most notably Alpha Kappa Psi, a business fraternity holding positions from Service Chairman, VP of Finance, and President. 
                                Argent also held an executive financial advisory position in the Robotics Club, the largest club at OSU with over 300 student members. Argent holds
                                certificates in Full-Stack Development with React Specialization, Google IT Support and Automation with Python Specialization, and AWS Fundamentals.

                                Argent on his free time enjoys learning anything from technology to history and the arts. He is also an avid adventurer and considers himself a nomad at times.
                                Some of his hobbies include reading, trading/investing in the stock market, and lifting weights. Fun fact about him is that he is multi-lingual, speaking Persian, Russian,
                                and English but if you also want to consider programming languages the list just goes on.
