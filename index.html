                        <p>Pavel has over 7 years of experience programming and innovating and 4 years of management/leadership. During the last year of high school at 17 he worked
                             for a small Computer Repair company building, designing, and managing websites. Most websites were for small businesses including a site to 
                             sell plants for a nursery and a record store. While attending Oregon State University Pavel worked as a project lead for Oregon State 
                             Robotics Club for 2 years. He also founded his own club Oregon State Combat Robotics where he grew the club to over 40 members in his 
                             first year and continued to gain members throughout the covid outbreak. After completing Oregon State University with a degree in Computer 
                             Science Pavel was hired as an Automation Engineer designing and implementing new systems and features. </p>

                        <p class="d-none d-sm-block">During Pavels free time he enjoys learning new technologies and languages. He spends time working on new robots 
                            and car projects constantly. Pavels hobbies include combat robotics, stock trading, and videogames. He enjoys lower level programming languages but is 
                            also fluent in web and higher level programming languages like Python, PHP, JS, HTML.</p>

                                Argent at 18 had started
                                a painting business bringing in over $50,000 in sales in a new and foreign environment at affordable rates to clients who were in dire need of a paint job.
                                He hired and trained painters as well as established a vendor relationship with Sherwin-Williams. At 20, he started an e-commerce business and within two years built two succesful stores making
                                over five and six figures respectively, SicWatches and SmartTechPicks. At Oregon State University, Argent was part of many organizations, 
                                most notably Alpha Kappa Psi, a business fraternity holding executive positions as VP of Finance and President for over a year. 
                                Argent also held an executive financial advisory position in the Robotics Club, the largest club at OSU with over 300 student members. Argent currently works as a Network Engineer automating and scaling IT infrastructure.
                                He also holds certificates in Full-Stack Development with React Specialization, Google IT Support and Automation with Python Specialization, and AWS Fundamentals.

                                Argent on his free time enjoys learning anything from technology to history and the arts. He is also an avid adventurer and considers himself a nomad at times.
                                Some of his hobbies include reading, trading/investing in the stock market, and lifting weights. Fun fact about him is that he is multi-lingual, speaking Persian, Russian,
                                and English but if you also want to consider programming languages the list just goes on.
